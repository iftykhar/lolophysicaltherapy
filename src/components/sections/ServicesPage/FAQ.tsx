    {
      question: "Do I need a doctor’s referral to start physical therapy?",
      answer:
        "No! In Montana, you have Direct Access to physical therapy, which means you can see a physical therapist without a doctor’s referral. However, some insurance plans may still require a referral for coverage, so it’s always a good idea to check with your insurance provider or call our office for assistance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I expect at my first appointment?",
      answer:
        "Your first visit includes a thorough evaluation by a licensed physical therapist, discussion of your medical history, and a personalized treatment plan tailored to your goals. You’ll also receive education and, in most cases, start treatment the same day.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I wear to my appointments?",
      answer:
        "Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows easy movement. Athletic wear or clothes that let your therapist access the area being treated (such as shorts for a knee injury) are best.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long are physical therapy sessions?",
      answer:
        "Most sessions last about 45–60 minutes, depending on your specific treatment plan and progress.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often will I need to come in for therapy?",
      answer:
        "Frequency depends on your condition and goals. Many patients attend 2–3 times per week initially, with frequency tapering as you improve.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you accept my insurance?",
      answer:
        "We work with most major insurance providers and will verify your benefits before your first visit. We will do our best to help explain your coverage, co-pays, and any out-of-pocket costs to mitigate any surprises. Be sure to contact your insurance company for understanding of your coverage.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don’t have insurance?",
      answer:
        "We offer self-pay options and flexible payment plans for patients without insurance. Our goal is to make high-quality care accessible to everyone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can physical therapy help if I’ve already had surgery?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Post-surgical rehabilitation is one of the most common reasons patients see us. We’ll help you safely restore strength, mobility, and confidence in your movement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What conditions do you treat?",
      answer:
        "We treat a wide range of orthopedic and musculoskeletal issues including back and neck pain, joint injuries, post-surgical recovery, sports injuries, balance problems, and chronic pain conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I schedule an appointment?",
      answer:
        "You can schedule by calling our office, send us an email, or have your physician send us a referral and we will follow up with you as soon as we can. If you don’t hear from us, please call to get on our schedule!",
