From the first day, she made me feel comfortable and cared for. I never felt silly just supported! Madeline not only listens to me but has actively helped me to feel great while always smiling with gentle words of encouragement!
I would recommend Dr. May to anyone looking for a wonderful physical therapist!”

His breadth of knowledge and experience is evident in the way He explains any exercises, the need for specific movements, and why long-term they are important.I highly recommend him to others, and credit Lolo Physical Therapy with their attention to detail.
Because of them, I've regained my mobility and strength.”

In the first ten minutes, she identified the root cause for the injury which I never would have thought as a contributor. During the consults she took the time to understand my needs, capabilities and time constraints and gave me excersises which made the injury feel better within days and clear it up completely over the long term. She described and wrote down the home excersises in a way I could understand which helped me ensure I was doing them correctly. Its always worth the travel time to see Madeline. Its nice to feel like youre working with a pt who's goal is to treat patients not increase profits.”`,
